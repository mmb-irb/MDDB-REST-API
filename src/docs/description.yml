      description: >
        The 'data' array has an object for each defined interaction containing distances per residue data.
        Note that interactions are defined at the project metadata.
        Distances are stored in the form of two matrices: one for the mean and one for the standard deviation
        in the distance between each pair of residues for each residue in each interacting agent.
        Matrix values are sorted according to interaction agent residues order.
        Matrix values are organized as an array of arrays with numeric values.
        Each array with numeric values contains the mean distance/distance standard deviation values between
        each residue from the interaction agent 1 and one residue from the agent 2. Each array with numeric values
        is represented as a row in the client matrix representation.
        Note that the count of numeric values on each array must match the number of resiudes in agent 1 and
        the count of arrays must match the number of residues in agent 2.

    'RMSD pairwise analysis':
      type: object
      description: >
        The start (deprecated*) and step values stand for trajectory frames.
        The 'data' array has an object for the overall structure and an additional object for each defined
        interaction. Each object contains a name which is the interaction name or 'Overall' for the overall
        structure. Note that interactions are defined at the project metadata.
        RMSD values are stored in the form of a matrix where both rows and columns stand for different frames.
        Matrix values are organized as an array of arrays with numeric values.
        Each array with numeric values contains the RMSD values between each different frame and one specific frame.
        * The starting frame is deprecated since it is not used by the client anymore. The start frame in all
        "framed" analyses is always the trajectory first frame.
